# Lagrange Interpolationer
I wrote this myself for fun.
## Example:
input.txt:
```text
1
3
5
7
114514
```
output:
```text
f(x) = 114504 + x*(2862601/-12) + x^2*(4007675/24) + x^3*(572525/-12) + x^4*(114505/24)
Process finished with exit code 0
```

## Future Expectations:
- [ ] Graphical Interface
- [ ] Better Algorithms
- [ ] Smaller Code
- [ ] High Accuracy
- [ ] 2D/3D Data Support
